# Introduction to Atlas
Imagine a world where you can make financial promises with someone and can be guaranteed that it will be kept. This is the world that smart contracts promise us. However, not everyone is able to understand the code that smart contracts are written in. We want to make smart contracts accessible to the average person, as believe that promises should be simple and easy to understand.

# What you can do with it
Record a short audio clip of spoken words, and Atlas will transform it into smart contract that is virtually incorruptible on the Hedera blockchain!
